## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- A Supabase account (free tier works great)
- Git for version control

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Supabase Setup

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
2. Wait for the database to initialize (takes ~2 minutes)
3. Go to the SQL Editor in your Supabase dashboard
4. Run the database schema files from the `sql-schema/` folder:
   - Start with `teams.sql` and `user_profiles.sql`
   - Then run all other table schema files
   - Finally run `rls-policies.sql` for security
5. See `sql-schema/README.md` for the complete list of schema files

### 2. Environment Variables

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Get your Supabase credentials:
   - Go to Project Settings → API
   - Copy the `Project URL` and `anon/public` key

3. Update `.env` with your credentials:
   ```
   SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url_here
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
   ```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## 📱 Pages & Routes

- `/` - Landing page with main navigation
- `/training` - Employee training management
- `/details` - Job functions, shifts, and employee configuration
- `/schedule/[date]` - Edit schedule for a specific date
  - Example: `/schedule/2025-10-21`
- `/schedule/tomorrow` - Create tomorrow's schedule (blank or copy)
- `/display` - TV display mode (read-only, auto-refresh)

## 🎨 Database Schema

The application uses 6 main tables:

1. **employees** - Employee information
2. **job_functions** - Job roles with colors and productivity rates
3. **employee_training** - Junction table for employee-job training
4. **shifts** - Shift schedules with break times
5. **schedule_assignments** - Daily employee assignments
6. **daily_targets** - Production targets by job function

See the `sql-schema/` folder for individual table schemas and `sql-schema/README.md` for documentation.
