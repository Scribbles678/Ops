# Rate Limiting Configuration
# 
# Rate limiting is handled by multiple layers:
# 1. Supabase Auth (login attempts: 30 per 5 minutes per IP = 360 per hour)
#    - Configured in Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Rate Limits
#    - Already active and protecting login endpoints
#
# 2. Netlify's built-in DDoS protection
#    - Automatic protection against distributed attacks
#    - No configuration needed
#
# 3. Application-level rate limiting (via server middleware)
#    - Protects API routes: 100 requests per minute per IP
#    - Implemented in server/middleware/rate-limit.ts
