# Rate Limiting Notes:
# - Rate limiting is handled by application-level middleware (server/middleware/rate-limit.ts)
# - Supabase Auth also provides rate limiting (configured in Supabase Dashboard)
# - Netlify's built-in DDoS protection is automatic
# - For Netlify-level rate limiting, configure in Netlify UI or add to function files directly
