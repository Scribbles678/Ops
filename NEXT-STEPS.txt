OPERATIONS SCHEDULING TOOL - YOUR NEXT STEPS
===============================================

Your complete scheduling application has been built! Here's exactly what to do:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
STEP 1: SET UP SUPABASE (5 minutes)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Go to: https://supabase.com
2. Click "Start your project" (sign up with GitHub/Google)
3. Click "New Project"
   - Name: "operations-scheduling" (or your choice)
   - Database Password: (create a strong password)
   - Region: Choose closest to you
   - Click "Create new project"
4. Wait ~2 minutes for setup to complete
5. Click "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
6. Click "New Query"
7. Open the file "supabase-schema.sql" in this folder
8. Copy ALL contents and paste into the SQL Editor
9. Click "Run" (or press Ctrl+Enter)
10. You should see "Success. No rows returned"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
STEP 2: GET YOUR SUPABASE CREDENTIALS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. In Supabase, click the gear icon (⚙️) for "Project Settings"
2. Click "API" in the left menu
3. Find these two values:
   
   Project URL:
   [Copy this - looks like: https://xxxxx.supabase.co]
   
   anon public key:
   [Copy this - long string starting with "eyJ"]

Keep these handy for the next step!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
STEP 3: CREATE YOUR .env FILE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. In the "scheduling-app" folder, create a file named ".env"
2. Add these two lines (paste your actual values):

SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here

(No quotes, no spaces around the = sign)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
STEP 4: INSTALL AND RUN
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Open your terminal/PowerShell in the scheduling-app folder and run:

   npm install

Then start the dev server:

   npm run dev

The app will open at: http://localhost:3000

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
STEP 5: TEST IT OUT!
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Try these in order:

1. Click "Details" → "Employees" tab
   - Sample employees are already there from seed data
   - Add your real employees if needed

2. Click "Details" → "Job Functions" tab
   - Sample functions are loaded (RT-Pick, EM9 Packsize, etc.)
   - Edit colors and rates as needed
   - Add your specific job functions

3. Click "Update Training"
   - Check boxes to show which employees are trained in which functions
   - Click "Save Changes"

4. Click "Edit Today's Schedule"
   - Click "+ Add Assignment"
   - Select: Employee, Job Function, Shift, Times
   - Click "Create"
   - See it appear in the schedule!

5. Set Daily Targets in the sidebar
   - Enter target units for each job function
   - Watch the labor hours calculation update

6. Click "Open Display Mode (TV View)"
   - See the full-screen view
   - This refreshes automatically every 30 seconds

TROUBLESHOOTING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

❌ "Failed to fetch" errors
   → Check your .env file has correct URL and key
   → Make sure no extra spaces or quotes
   → Restart dev server after changing .env

❌ Blank page or errors
   → Check terminal for error messages
   → Make sure you ran the SQL schema in Supabase
   → Open browser console (F12) to see errors

❌ Can't create assignments
   → Make sure employees exist
   → Make sure job functions exist
   → Check that employee is trained in that function
